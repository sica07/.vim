javascriptLint.vim allows the JavaScript Lint (jsl) program from http://www.javascriptlint.com to be tightly integrated with Vim.  The contents of a javascript file will be passed through the jsl program after the file's buffer is saved.  Any lint warnings will be placed in the quickfix error window.
